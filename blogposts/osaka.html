                <p>We spent our last 2 days in Japan exploring Osaka! We really wanted to visit Nara, which is a popular tourist spot to feed deers but we didn’t have enough time since it was a few hours outside of Osaka and it didn’t make sense to use a whole day there (hopefully next time!).</p>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaTemple.jpg" style="width:16em;height:20em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">Gorgeous front gate views of Shitennoji Temple!</span>

                <p>Osaka was pretty different from Kyoto and Tokyo, even though they were all pretty big cities and tourist attractions. Osaka was a lot more shopping-centered and I saw so many tourists carrying their suitcases and putting in everything they bought.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Here’s our first day in a nutshell:</h2>
                <p> ✧ Butter Pancakes </br>
                    ✧ Atchichi Honpo Takoyaki</br>
                    ✧ Kiyasu Sohonpo</br>
                    ✧ Shinsaibashi Shopping</br>
                    ✧ Shitennoji Temple</br>
                    ✧ Ichiran Ramen</br>
                    ✧ Dotonburi Foods</p>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaManhole.jpg" style="width:16em;height:20em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">We started taking pics of all the aesthetic manhole covers in Japan lol</span>

                <p>Osaka is like a weekend shopping trip for those that are close enough, there were many Chinese tourists from what I remember. We also found out that there was a Universal Studios  nearby after we noticed all the little kids had cute souvenirs from there, if we knew we would’ve tried to save a day for that tbh!</p>

                <p>One of the desserts I was looking forward to the most in Japan was the fluffy pancakes! We went to Butter, which was a popular dessert spot in Osaka (I think they also have locations in other cities) and tried them for the first time.</p>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaFluff.jpg" style="width:16em;height:16em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">Creme Brulee Fluffy Pancakes from Butter in Osaka, Japan</span>

                <p>These were hella aesthetic and super tasty! Which reminds me, many restaurants in Japan enforce a rule where the table must order as many items as there are people in the party. So each person must order at least something.</p>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaConveorBelt%20sushi.jpg" style="width:16em;height:18em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">Also stopped by a conveyor belt sushi place!</span>

                <p>It’s a great way to try out different menu items, but some places are a bit pricier and if you’re trying to save money but also want to try a bunch of restaurants like us, try to order a drink and a dish for each restaurant so you’ll still be following their rules!</p>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaShopping.jpg" style="width:16em;height:20em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">Shopping and street food near Shinsaibashi, Osaka</span>

                <p>Back on one of the main shopping streets of Osaka, Shinsaibashi, we saw so many takoyaki, gyoza, and dango stands! There’s also a street with mostly all restaurants as well as arcades and shopping centers. This was also where people were most highly concentrated in Osaka.</p>

                <p>We had to try some takoyaki since we were trying them in every city in Japan we visited! We looked for the one with the longest line since there were so many options, not a great way to choose but it worked out haha!</p>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaTakoyaki.jpg" style="width:16em;height:18em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">How they make takoyaki!</span>

                <span class="caption text-muted">The softest takoyaki straight from the grill</span>

                <p>We also stopped by the Shitennoji Temple, one of my favorite temples in Japan!</p>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaTemple2.jpg" style="width:16em;height:18em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">One of the main buildings in the temple</span>

                </br>

                <span class="caption text-muted">Walking through this reminds of Saiunkoku Monogatari anime LOL</span>

                <p>For dinner, we were originally going to go to this ramen place we had on our itinerary but then the place was fully packed. We tried to find a new place but almost every place was so full, we picked up some chicken skewers sold by this street vendor by the river/canal and it was so scenic and peaceful.</p>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaSkewers.jpg" style="width:16em;height:18em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">Super juicy chicken skewers along the shopping canal</span>

                </br>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaShoppingNight.jpg" style="width:16em;height:18em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">The views at night along the shopping canal!</span>

                <p>There also seemed to be a lot of bars and nightclubs on the strip along the canal so that’s something to look forward to if you’re interested! Eventually, we miraculously got a seat at Ichiran Ramen, which was even more popular but we got lucky they had a table for 2 left since most people there were in groups.</p>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaIchiran.jpg" style="width:16em;height:20em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">Ichiran Ramen in Osaka, Japan</span>

                <h2 class="section-heading">On our second (and last :c) day, we hit up:</h2>
                <p> ✧ Marufuji Dango/Dessert </br>
                    ✧ Osaka Castle</br>
                    ✧ Kushikatsu Daruma (Skewers)</br>
                    ✧ MAISON de gigi waffles</br>
                    ✧ Hokkyokusei - Omurice</br>
                    ✧ Kougaryu Shinsaibashi Takoyaki </p>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaShopping2.jpg" style="width:16em;height:20em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">The busy shopping streets of Osaka are always packed</span>

                <p>So weird to think that this was officially our last day in Japan :(. We were pretty sad about this and even though we got to do a lot with our 10 days here, it feels like we still had so much more to see, hopefully we’ll be visiting again in a year or two!</p>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaWaffle.jpg" style="width:16em;height:20em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">Strawberry Waffle from MAISON de gigi</span>

                <p>So we did stop by another shopping street (since Osaka seemed to be all about that haha) and found some really cute dessert places. I got a strawberry creme dipped waffle from MAISON de gigi and we also had some bubble tea!</p>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaBoba.jpg" style="width:16em;height:20em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">Milk Tea w/ Herbal Jelly from Chatime!</span>

                <p>I only got boba twice in Japan (once at The Alley in Tokyo and the second time at Chatime in Osaka! For some reason, I thought I’d see a lot more boba here but we found out when visiting China that that’s where all the boba shops are LOL.</p>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaCastle.jpg" style="width:16em;height:20em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">Osaka Castle's gorgeous detailing!</span>

                <p>Our last tourist site that we hit up in Osaka was Osaka Castle, a beautiful white castle with green and grey tile detailing. It was literally in the middle of a small body of water, which I think was on purpose to prevent enemies from reaching the castle?</p>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaCastleMe.jpg" style="width:16em;height:21em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">Me with the huge body of water surrounding the castle hehe</span>

                </br>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaViews.jpg" style="width:20em;height:16em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">Views from the top of the castle!</span>


                <p>The interior was recently renewed and it was full of history, it was basically a museum inside a castle! Also, there was this cute tiny garden next to it, as well as a food court, it was like a tiny city inside the castle.</p>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaGarden.jpg" style="width:20em;height:16em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">A beautiful mini garden with a fish pond and flowers!</span>

                <p>There were also so many storks or cranes (?), I’m actually not sure what kind of birds they were but they were just chillin’ walking around with the tourists LOL. It was also really hot since we were nearing June and the ice cream vending machines had waaaay better options than the ones in the U.S. omg.</p>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaCrane.jpg" style="width:16em;height:20em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">A crane(I think?) just walking around with the tourists lol</span>

                </br>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaIceCream.jpg" style="width:16em;height:20em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">Some bomb ice cream from a vending machine</span>

                <p>After this, we picked up some Omurice (my fave!!), which is basically fried rice inside an egg omelet with some ketchup! I’ve seen tutorials but honestly it looks pretty hard to make lol, but I also probably got omurice in at least 2 of the cities we were in.</p>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaOmurice.jpg" style="width:20em;height:16em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">Omurice at a shopping center in Osaka!</span>

                <p>After that, we walked around a large shopping center (I swear Osaka is for the shopaholics LOL) but we couldn’t really buy anything because our baggage was way too full, especially since we had some stuff we were bringing for relatives in China.</p>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaTrain.jpg" style="width:20em;height:16em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">Taking a train to the airport now :(</span>

                <p>We took a train to the airport and arrived 2 hours before our flight but the lines were HELL. I think it’s because it was a weekend and many tourists were also heading back (we were flying to Shanghai).</p>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaLastMeal.jpg" style="width:16em;height:20em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">Our last meal in Osaka at the airport ;-;</span>

                <p>We picked up some food and ended up trying so hard to stuff our shit into our suitcases that were already stuffed to meet the 4 piece carryon rule for our super cheap flight LOL.</p>

                <p>It was pretty hard, especially since they had duty-free shops in the airport (which means tax free shopping) and we bought some Tokyo Bananas for relatives in China, which we had to try to stuff into my bag smh.</p>

                <a><img src="../img/osakaPlane.jpg" style="width:16em;height:20em; padding:5px;border:2px solid #868e96;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></a>
                <span class="caption text-muted">On our way to Shanghai, China, stay tuned!</span>

                <p>After this, we finally got on our flight after many long lines and were on our way to the major leg of our trip, 30 days in China!</p>
